# SpacemanDMM Python Bindings

This library provides bindings for [SpacemanDMM](https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM) in Python. The primary goal
is to enable inspection of the AST.

## Usage

The library can be installed off of the Github repository, using pip. You need to have the rust compiler installed, and
[maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) is required as a dependency.

Installation with the rust compiler already installed is as follows:
```
> pip install maturin
> pip install git+https://github.com/skull132/sdmm_python.git
```

And that is it. You can now `import sdmm_python` and away you go.

See basic usage examples in the "examples" directory of this repository.
